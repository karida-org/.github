## Reporting Problems

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/karida-org) to track public bugs. Please
ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to
reproduce the issue. If possible please provide a minimal demo of the problem.
Please follow these steps:

* Search the issues to see if your problem has already been reported. If so, add
  any extra context you might have found, or at least indicate that you too are
  having the problem. This will help us prioritize common issues.
* If your problem is unreported, create a new issue for it.
* In your report include explicit instructions to replicate your issue.

## Security Issues

Security issues should not be reported via Github issues. Please see
[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for details on how to report security issues.
