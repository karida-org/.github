# AGENTS

Organization policy for AI agents:

- [karida-org/.github agent policy](https://github.com/karida-org/.github/blob/main/docs/agent-policy.md)

Repositories may add a local `AGENTS.md` with repo-specific guidance (commands, conventions, architecture).
Do not copy org-wide policy into repo files; link to the policy doc instead.

## Working agreements

- Ask for confirmation before adding new production dependencies.
- Must not use long dash `—`
