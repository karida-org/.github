# Agent Policy

This document defines organization-wide guidance for AI agents working in Karida
repositories. Repository-specific rules may extend this policy but should not
conflict with it.

Related org docs:

- `docs/context-maintenance.md`
- `docs/roadmap-workflow.md`
- `docs/tooling.md`

## Repository AGENTS.md files

- Keep repo `AGENTS.md` focused on repo-specific guidance (commands, architecture, conventions, tests).
- Do not copy org-wide policy into repo files; link to this document instead to avoid drift.
- Repo rules may extend this policy but should be minimal and must not conflict.

## Issue-first workflow

- Required for feature/bugfix work that affects user-facing behavior or touches multiple files.
- Optional for docs, typos, and small single-file refactors.
- Use the repo issue template if present.
- Branch naming: `issue-<n>-<slug>` from `main`.
- Manual merge after checks pass.

Recommended command flow:

```bash
gh issue create --template issue-first.md --label "<label>"
git checkout -b issue-<n>-<slug>
pnpm lint && pnpm test
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "Fixes #<n>" --label "<label>"
```

## Labels

- Apply labels on issues and PRs (use existing defaults like `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).

## Safety and hygiene

- Never commit secrets or private keys.
- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.
- Keep changes minimal and aligned with existing patterns.

## Code reviews

- Check for review comments after opening PRs (including Codex and human reviewers).
- Address feedback promptly and resolve review threads when the change is applied.
