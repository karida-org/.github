# Roadmap and Todo Workflow

Use GitHub issues as the source of truth for roadmap items and tasks.

## Issue usage

- Create issues for feature/bugfix work above the threshold in the agent policy.
- Keep issues small and scoped; split large items into multiple issues.
- Close issues via PRs using "Fixes #<n>".

## Milestones (by phase)

- Group issues by phase (e.g., `MVP`, `Beta`, `Public`)
- Keep milestones short and outcome-focused.
- Move incomplete issues forward instead of extending milestone dates.

## Labels

- Use existing defaults: `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation`.
- Add phase labels only if milestones are not sufficient.
